# Streaming Processing of the QUAX Experiment Data for the Detection of Galactic Axions

Final project for *Management and Analysis of Physics Dataset (Mod. B)* course, Physics of Data degree at University of Padova.

## Abstract

The axion is a hypothetical particle introduced to solve the strong CP problem of Quantum Chromo Dynamics. It is speculated that axions may also constitute the dark matter content in our galaxy. The [QUAX](https://www.pd.infn.it/eng/quax/) (QUaerere AXions) experiment aims at detecting this particle by using a copper cavity immersed in a static magnetic field of 8.1 T, cooled down at a working temperature of about 150 mK.

The goal of this project is to create a quasi real-time processing chain of the data produced by the QUAX experimental apparatus and a live monitoring system of the detector data, using [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).

## Repository Structure

The code for this project is divided into 3 files, each one concerning one of the 3 main topics of the proessing chain: **Kafka**, **Spark** and **Live Plot**. The file **Presentation** contains the report detailing our thought process and explaining the results we found. Finally, in the **Images** directory one can find all the photos, plots and videos that have been used in the report.
